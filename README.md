# dip - a smol Scoop bucket
This repo contains some of the tools I use and are not available in the official Scoop buckets.

## Installation

After installing [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), add this bucket by typing:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add dip https://github.com/NECOtype/dip
```

Then you can install the tools in my bucket using:

```pwsh
scoop install dip/<manifestname>
```
